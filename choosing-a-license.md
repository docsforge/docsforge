Choosing a license
==================

When creating a new project, you must choose a license.

The [most popular open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/category) are:

- [Apache License, 2.0 (Apache-2.0)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
- [BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license (BSD-3-Clause)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)
- [BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" license (BSD-2-Clause)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)
- [GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPL-2.0)](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0)
- [GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0)](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)

If your desired license does not appear in this list, please choose `Other`. You can elaborate further in the License section created on the first `Basic Tutorial` page.

!!! note
    There must always be a License section in the first `Basic Tutorial` page, as there are links pointing to it.

If you've never chosen a license before, here's a nice explanation from http://www.choosealicense.com/

Editing a license
-----------------

You can edit your license in your project settings <code><i class="fa fa-cog"></i></code>. 

Do remember that changing to a less permissive license can affect your users, and the popularity of your project.
